## :floppy_disk: Cool tech
- Node.js and Node Project Manager
- Single Page Application structure for our front-end
- Express.js to create our own server-side 'API' for storing and retrieving tasks
- The Bored API to find random tasks to do if someone's stuck for ideas!
## :wrench: Bugs to fix :space_invader:
- State will only hold lists/tasks stored in the current session, need it to hold tasks/lists made in the current session AND the current user's tasks & lists
- Update/delete list crashes server if not signed in
- Task generator throws undefined if no tasks exist in the external API with the given parameters
- Viewing lists as a guest doesn't currently work
- Storing lists/tasks to state on login currently doesn't work
